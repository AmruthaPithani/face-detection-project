## Project Overview:
This project is a Face Detection System built using Python and OpenCV. It helps in capturing and detecting faces in images.

## Dependencies:

You need to install the required libraries for each script before running them:
# For the face capture script, install opencv-python by running:
pip install opencv-python
# For the face detection script, install scikit-learn by running:
pip install scikit-learn
## Running the Scripts:

# Face Capture Script:
Run this script after installing the opencv-python library. It captures images of faces using your webcam.
# Command:
python face_capture.py
# Face Detection Script:
Run this script after installing the scikit-learn library. It uses the captured images to detect faces.
# Command:
python face_detection.py
